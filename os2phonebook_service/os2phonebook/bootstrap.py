    """Check connection status to the datastore.

    This functionality is mainly used in a docker context
    in order to delay the application startup in the
    entrypoint until the elasticsearch container is responding.

    Args:
        config (dict): A dictionary containing configuration.
        interval (int): Time in between the connection attempts.
        max_attempts (int): The total amount of attempts to connect.

    Yields:
        str: Progress update messages.
            This will be displayed in a terminal rather than in a log file.

            Example output:
